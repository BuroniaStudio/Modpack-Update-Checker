To use YUNG's Better End Island on existing worlds either reset the End dimension or run the /end_island reset command.

=====================>
Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with the redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so please back up your world before trying!
=====================>

AS ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR WORLD BEFORE UPDATING
